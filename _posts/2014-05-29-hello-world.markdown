So this is first post in Suitmedia Engineering Blog. 
We use [Jekyll][jekyll] for the blogging platform and we use [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] for the hosting.

For **Suitmedia Developers**: You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes! 
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Nabilah JKT48')
#=> prints 'Hi, Nabilah JKT48' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Scientia potentia est. Knowledge is power.
